The program automatically detects the servers, within which the info.txt creates the properties of the server.
feel free to change these. in settings.json it is written which line is responsible for why

A server consists of the server folder itself, a server.jar file in the folder, and that's enough for Runner to run.

the jar file should not contain any dots so somehow look at server.jar. you can use points if you really want but you have to edit info.txt
