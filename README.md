# ServerRunner-OLD

Hi, This is one of my first major c # programs, so there's a chance it will crash. It is a program that manages minecraft servers with the goal of making it easier to manage multiple servers. (I think I have achieved)


The program is running on .NET 5, so it must be installed on your computer
